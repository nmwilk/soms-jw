# The State of Managing State with RxJava

Write up in Kotlin of Jake Wharton's talk - http://jakewharton.com/the-state-of-managing-state-with-rxjava/

See tag `pre34mins` for code prior to `Action`/`Result` abstraction.

See tag `complete` for code that does everything the talk does (except the View > Action abstraction)
